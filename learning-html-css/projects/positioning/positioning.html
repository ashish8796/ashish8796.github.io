                <p>"Apply styles when the user has scrolled away from the top" is a legit use case. It makes me think of a once function (like we have in jQuery) where any scroll event would only be triggered once and then not again. They scrolled! So, by definition, they aren't at the top anymore! But that doesn't deal with when they scroll back to the top</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, we don't have greater than (>) less than (<) selectors in CSS for things like numbered attributes, so the CSS styling potential is fairly limited here. You might ultimately need to update the JavaScript function such that it applies other classes or data attributes based on your math. But you'll already be set up for good performance here.</p>
